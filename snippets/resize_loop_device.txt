  https://askubuntu.com/a/260679

You can use sudo losetup /dev/loop0 to see what file the loopback device is attached to, 
then you can increase its size with, for example,

   sudo dd if=/dev/zero bs=1MiB of=/path/to/file conv=notrunc oflag=append count=xxx 

where xxx is the number of MiB you want to add. 

After that,

sudo losetup -c /dev/loop0 

sudo resize2fs /dev/loop0 

should make the new space available for use.
